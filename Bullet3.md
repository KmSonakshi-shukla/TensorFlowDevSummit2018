Used for robotics
gaming
A smart interacting robots. A robot falls down again and again but learns after multiple fall events. bots.
Then the model trains itself. Likewise it works like charm.

Deep reinforcement learning: Most active field of machine learning. Trying to make robots. Let them interact like a baby experiments on itrs own.
